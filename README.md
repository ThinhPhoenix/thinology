# Vue 3 + Vite

Welcome to the Vue 3 + Vite template! This template is designed to help you quickly get started with developing using Vue 3 and Vite. With the update to Vue 3, you can now take advantage of the new `<script setup>` syntax in Single File Components (SFCs). If you're not familiar with it, you can learn more about it in the [script setup documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup).

## Recommended IDE Setup

To make your development experience even better, we recommend setting up the following IDE:

- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- **Plugin:** Vue - Official (formerly Volar)
- **Action:** Disable Vetur

By using this combination, you'll have a seamless development environment that will enhance your productivity.

Feel free to explore and experiment with this template. It's not just a starting point for your projects, but also a showcase of your tech skills. Use it as your portfolio to share your tech projects and accomplishments.

Happy coding with Vue 3 and Vite!
